# PicoCraft
 A bare-bones Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 Server that can run on a Raspberry Pi Pico W.

# Building
Just use the Arduino IDE and flash it on as you would with any other Arduino Project.

Remember to set your WiFis ssid and password so the Pi can connect.

Alternatively you can enable AP Mode, which lets the Pi make its own network (but this limits you to only 4 Clients)
